#X text 24 29 Most objects working on arrays/buffers are multichannel.
The toolbox uses the following convention: a named array is expected
to have a name \, followed by -x where x is the 'channel' number \,
0-indexed. For instance \, a stereo source buffer defined as 'mybuf'
will expect an array named 'mybuf-0' for the left channel \, and an
array named 'mybuf-1' for the right channel. A utility [multiarray.pd]
is used throughout the helpfiles in conjonction with the [clone] to
programmatically generate such 'multichannel' buffers.;
