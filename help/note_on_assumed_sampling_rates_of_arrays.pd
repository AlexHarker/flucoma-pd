#X text 19 20 As PureData arrays are simply list of numbers \, they
do not have a sampling rate per se \, and therefore the frequency of
the various descriptors can only be as true as long as we provide the
algorythm with a sampling rate. By default \, the objects will take
the current sampling rate of the real-time audio \, but a [sr VALUE]
message can be send to the object to change that value \, should that
be desired and/or required.;
